## Overview

This repository contains a small, application-oriented presentation of **CaloCem** that I prepared for an austrian building materials company. The goal is not to show the full complexity of the tool, but to demonstrate a few simple, practical workflows in a way that is accessible even for colleagues without any programming background.

The code is intentionally kept minimal (no loops, no advanced Python concepts) and focuses on a few clear examples: loading data (showing multiple times), running selected CaloCem functions and visualising the results. I am still learning the deeper programmatic background functions of CaloCem myself, so this repository is meant as a very small, beginner-friendly entry point that shows what the tool can already do in a simple, visual form.
